# Project 1 - Movie Trailer Website
This project dynamically builds a web page using Python. The resulting page is a listing of my personal favorite movies with links to each movie's trailer.

### How can I get the code?
Feel free to Fork your own version of this code and play around within the three files.

### What are the technical requirements?
Since the program is based in Python 2.7, it is essential that you have Python 2.7 installed on your machine.

### What's Included
Within the download you'll find the following files:
```
entertainment_center.py
media.py
fresh_tomatoes.py
example.html
```

### How do I run the application?
Running entertainment_center.py will generate an HTML web page. The page will automatically launch in your default web browser. An example .html file is included as a reference for what the page should look like upon running entertainment_center.py.

### Application Features
* Hover over a movie panel to view a single sentence synopsis of the movie.
* Click a movie to launch the movie's trailer.
